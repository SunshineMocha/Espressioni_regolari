    Lexi was a 19-year-old streamer who had been streaming for the past couple of months. She had been successful at it, gaining a lot of followers, and had even started earning some money from it. However, one day she started feeling overwhelmed and anxious, and it suddenly became too much for her to handle. She had a panic attack while streaming, and she couldn't stop it.

Her mother, Maria, who was in the next room over, heard her daughter's cries and immediately rushed to her side. She found Lexi lying on the floor, shaking and crying uncontrollably. Maria knew immediately that her daughter was having a panic attack, so she sat down next to her and started holding her hand.

"Lexi, my dear, don't worry, everything is going to be alright," Maria said, trying to soothe her daughter.

But Lexi was in too much of a state of panic to hear her mother's words. She just continued to cry and shake.

Maria remained calm and started talking to Lexi in a soothing voice, telling her to focus on her breathing. "Take deep breaths, my dear. Breathe in deeply, and then exhale slowly," Maria instructed.

As Lexi tried to follow her mother's instructions, she realized that her breathing had become shallow and that she wasn't breathing properly. She started to focus on her mother's voice, and slowly but surely, her breathing became more natural, and she finally calmed down.

Maria continued holding Lexi's hand and stroking her hair until her daughter was completely calm, and the panic attack had passed.

"Thanks, mom," Lexi said as she sat up slowly, wiping her tears away.

"It's alright, my dear. I'm always here for you whenever you need me," replied Maria, giving her daughter a warm hug.

Lexi had been streaming for hours when she suddenly started feeling anxious. Her heart was racing and she couldn't catch her breath. She tried to shake it off, but her panic only got worse. She took her headset off and ran to her room, locking the door behind her.

Maria had been in the kitchen when she heard Lexi's loud footsteps and then the sound of the door slamming. She immediately knew that something was wrong. She rushed to Lexi's room and knocked on the door gently.

"Lexi, honey, are you ok?" Maria asked, trying to keep her voice calm.

"No, Mom, I'm not," Lexi sobbed, her voice muffled by the door.

Maria could hear the fear and desperation in her daughter's voice. She knew she needed to act fast. She took a deep breath and tried to think of the best way to help her daughter.

"Lexi, I'm going to stay here with you, ok? Let's take some deep breaths together," she said, her voice soft and soothing.

She could hear Lexi's sobs slowly turn into sniffles, and then into deep breaths, as she followed her mother's instructions. Maria knew that panic attacks could be scary, but she also knew that they would pass if Lexi remained calm.

They sat like that for a while, Maria holding on to her daughter tightly, as Lexi took deep breaths and tried to center herself. Slowly, the fear and anxiety subsided, and Lexi finally stopped crying.

"Mom, I'm sorry," she said, her voice small.

"There's nothing to be sorry for, Lexi," Maria replied, feeling relieved that her daughter was feeling better.

"I just get so overwhelmed sometimes, with streaming and everything," Lexi said, her voice full of sadness.

"I know, sweetie. We can talk about it together and figure out a way to make it easier for you," Maria said, her voice full of love and care.

With her mother's arms around her, Lexi felt the panic slowly melt away. She felt safe and loved, and knew that no matter what, her mother would always be there for her.
